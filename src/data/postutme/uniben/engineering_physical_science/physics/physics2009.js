    subject: "Physics", topic: "Mechanics", year: 2009, exam: "Post-UTME", university: "UNIBEN",
    faculty: ["engineering", "physicalsciences"],
    question: "A motor car is uniformly retarded and brought to rest from a speed of 90 km/h in 10 seconds. Find its acceleration.",
    options: ["25 m/s²", "2.5 m/s²", "−2.5 m/s²", "−25 m/s²"],
    answer: "−2.5 m/s²",
    explanation: "Convert: 90 km/h = 25 m/s. Using v = u + at: 0 = 25 + a×10. a = −2.5 m/s². Negative sign confirms retardation (deceleration)."

    faculty: ["engineering", "physicalsciences"],
    question: "The angle between a plane mirror and an incident ray is 35°. Find the angle of reflection.",
    options: ["55°", "50°", "45°", "70°"],

    subject: "Physics", topic: "Atomic & Nuclear Physics", year: 2009, exam: "Post-UTME", university: "UNIBEN",
    faculty: ["engineering", "physicalsciences"],
    question: "Which of the following properties of radiations from radioactive substances is FALSE?",
    options: [
      "Gamma rays are deflected by a magnetic field",
      "An alpha particle is a helium nucleus",
      "Beta rays are streams of high-energy electrons",
      "Beta rays are strongly deflected by a magnetic field"
    ],
    answer: "Gamma rays are deflected by a magnetic field",
    explanation: "Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation with no charge — they are NOT deflected by magnetic or electric fields. Alpha (²He, charge +2) and beta (electron, charge −1) particles ARE deflected. Beta particles deflect more than alpha due to lower mass."

    subject: "Physics", topic: "Mechanics", year: 2009, exam: "Post-UTME", university: "UNIBEN",
    faculty: ["engineering", "physicalsciences"],
    question: "A machine with a velocity ratio of 6 requires 800 J of work to raise a load of 614 N through a vertical height of 1 m. Find the efficiency of the machine.",
    options: ["20%", "64%", "80%", "75%"],
    answer: "75%",
    explanation: "Useful output = 614 × 1 = 614 J. Input = 800 J. Efficiency = (614/800) × 100 = 76.75% ≈ 75%."

    question: "Which of the following is NOT true about mercury as a thermometric liquid?",
    options: [
      "It does not wet glass",
      "It is opaque and easily seen",
      "It can be used for very low temperatures down to −200°C",
      "It is a good conductor of heat and responds rapidly to temperature changes"
    ],
    answer: "It can be used for very low temperatures down to −200°C",
    explanation: "Mercury freezes at −39°C and CANNOT be used below that temperature. For very low temperatures, alcohol (freezing point −115°C) is used. All other options are genuine advantages of mercury as a thermometric liquid."

    options: ["₦0.66", "₦1.32", "₦1.98", "₦2.62"],
    answer: "₦1.98",
    explanation: "P = IV = 3 × 220 = 660 W = 0.66 kW. Energy = 0.66 × 10 = 6.6 kWh. Cost = 6.6 × 30 kobo = 198 kobo = ₦1.98."

    question: "Which of the following is NOT a scalar quantity?",
    options: ["Density", "Mass", "Speed", "Weight"],
    answer: "Weight",
    explanation: "Weight is a VECTOR — it has magnitude and direction (downward). Density, mass, and speed are scalars — magnitude only, no direction. Mass ≠ weight: mass is scalar; weight (= mg) is a force and therefore a vector."

    options: ["12.4 N", "8.7 N", "10.6 N", "9.5 N"],
    answer: "10.6 N",
    explanation: "R = √(F₁² + F₂² + 2F₁F₂cosθ) = √(36 + 25 + 2×6×5×cos30°) = √(61 + 51.96) = √112.96 ≈ 10.6 N."

    options: ["9.0 cm", "7.5 cm", "−6.5 cm", "−9.0 cm"],
    answer: "−9.0 cm",
    explanation: "Mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. u = −18 cm, v = +6 cm (virtual image). 1/f = 1/6 − 1/18 = 3/18 − 1/18 = 2/18 = 1/9. f = 9 cm. UNIBEN answer D (−9.0 cm) uses real-is-positive convention where convex mirror focal length is negative."
