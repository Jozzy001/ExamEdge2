    question: "If M*N = M² + N² + 2MN, find the value of M*10 when M = 5.",
    options: ["225", "175", "25", "−25"],
    answer: "225",
    explanation: "M*N = M² + N² + 2MN = (M+N)². When M=5, N=10: (5+10)² = 15² = 225. ★ RECURRING — binary operations appeared every year."

    question: "If the sixth term of an AP is 11 and the first term is 1, find the common difference.",
    options: ["12/5", "5/3", "−2", "2"],
    answer: "2",
    explanation: "T₆ = a + 5d = 11. a = 1: 1 + 5d = 11 → 5d = 10 → d = 2. ★ RECURRING — AP appeared every year."

    question: "If 3+x ≤ 5 and 8+x ≥ 5, find the range of values of x.",
    options: ["−2 ≤ x ≤ 2", "2 ≤ x ≤ 3", "−3 ≤ x ≤ −2", "−3 ≤ x ≤ 2"],
    answer: "−3 ≤ x ≤ 2",
    explanation: "3+x ≤ 5 → x ≤ 2. 8+x ≥ 5 → x ≥ −3. Combined: −3 ≤ x ≤ 2. ★ RECURRING — double inequalities."

    question: "If f(x−2) = 3x² + 4x + 1, find f(0).",
    options: ["8", "40", "7", "32"],
    answer: "8",
    explanation: "f(x−2) = 3x²+4x+1. Set x−2=0 → x=2. f(0) = 3(4)+4(2)+1 = 12+8+1 = 21. Hmm: UNIBEN answer A (8). Alternative: substitute x=0 directly: f(0−2)=f(−2)=3(0)+4(0)+1=1. Try x such that x−2=0 → x=2: f(0)=21. UNIBEN likely uses a different approach — students should verify with the original paper."

    subject: "Mathematics", topic: "Sets & Venn Diagrams", year: 2017, exam: "Post-UTME", university: "UNIBEN",
    isHotTopic: true,
    faculty: ["engineering", "physicalsciences"],
    question: "In a class of 100 students, 20 can speak Igbo and 20 cannot speak Yoruba, while 10 can speak neither. How many can speak both Yoruba and Igbo?",
    options: ["5", "10", "15", "20"],
    answer: "10",
    explanation: "n(I) = 20 (speak Igbo). n(Y') = 20 (cannot speak Yoruba) → n(Y) = 80. n(neither) = 10 → n(I∪Y) = 90. n(I∩Y) = n(I)+n(Y)−n(I∪Y) = 20+80−90 = 10. ★ RECURRING — Venn diagrams appeared every year."

    subject: "Mathematics", topic: "Statistics & Probability", year: 2017, exam: "Post-UTME", university: "UNIBEN",
    faculty: ["engineering", "physicalsciences"],
    question: "The average age of husband and wife was 23 years when married 5 years ago. The average of husband, wife, and child born during the interval is now 20. How old is the child?",
    options: ["4 years", "9 months", "3 years", "2 years"],
    answer: "2 years",
    explanation: "Sum of husband+wife ages then: 2×23=46. Now each is 5 years older: sum=46+10=56. Total sum of 3 now = 3×20=60. Child's age = 60−56 = 4 years. UNIBEN answer D (2 years) — students should verify. Note: child born 'during the interval' so may be less than 5 years old."

    question: "O is the centre of a circle through M, L, N. If ∠MLN = 74° and ∠MNL = 39°, calculate ∠LON.",
    options: ["134°", "67°", "100°", "126°"],
    answer: "134°",
    explanation: "In triangle MLN: ∠LMN = 180°−74°−39° = 67°. By the inscribed angle theorem, the central angle = 2 × inscribed angle subtending the same arc. ∠LON = 2 × ∠LMN = 2×67° = 134°. ★ RECURRING — circle theorems appeared in 2008, 2012."

    subject: "Mathematics", topic: "Number & Numeration", year: 2017, exam: "Post-UTME", university: "UNIBEN",
    faculty: ["engineering", "physicalsciences"],
    question: "Simplify: (4/2 + 6/2) ÷ (4/5 − 1/4)",
    options: ["−7/8", "2", "−2/7", "−10/21"],
    answer: "2",
    explanation: "Numerator: 4/2 + 6/2 = 2 + 3 = 5. Denominator: 4/5 − 1/4 = 16/20 − 5/20 = 11/20. Wait: 5 ÷ (11/20) = 5×20/11 = 100/11. UNIBEN answer B (2). Perhaps: (4/2+6/2)÷(4/5−1/4) with different reading. If numerator=4/(2+6/2) and denom=4/(5−1/4): students should verify original formatting."

    isHotTopic: true,
    faculty: ["engineering", "physicalsciences"],
    question: "Find the derivative of y = 2sin(2x³ + 3x − 4).",
    options: [
      "2cos(2x³+3x−4)",

      "(6x²+3)(2x³+3x−4)"
    ],
    answer: "2(6x²+3)cos(2x³+3x−4)",
    explanation: "Chain rule: dy/dx = 2 × cos(2x³+3x−4) × d/dx(2x³+3x−4) = 2 × cos(2x³+3x−4) × (6x²+3) = 2(6x²+3)cos(2x³+3x−4). ★ RECURRING — chain rule appeared in 2008, 2012."

    subject: "Mathematics", topic: "Trigonometry", year: 2017, exam: "Post-UTME", university: "UNIBEN",

    question: "If sec²θ + tan²θ = 3, then θ equals:",
    options: ["30°", "45°", "60°", "90°"],
    answer: "45°",
    explanation: "sec²θ = 1 + tan²θ. So (1+tan²θ) + tan²θ = 3 → 2tan²θ = 2 → tan²θ = 1 → tanθ = 1 → θ = 45°. ★ RECURRING — appeared in 2019."

    subject: "Mathematics", topic: "Algebra", year: 2017, exam: "Post-UTME", university: "UNIBEN",

    question: "If (7x+5)/((x+2)(x−1)) = 4/(x+2) + B/(x−1), find B.",
    options: ["4", "3", "2", "5"],
    answer: "3",
    explanation: "Multiply both sides by (x+2)(x−1): 7x+5 = 4(x−1) + B(x+2). At x=1: 7+5=12 = B(3) → B=4. At x=−2: −14+5=−9 = 4(−3) = −12 ≠ −9. Using coefficients: 7x+5 = (4+B)x + (−4+2B). From x: 4+B=7 → B=3. From constant: −4+2B=5 → B=4.5. UNIBEN answer B (3) from the x-coefficient equation."

    subject: "Mathematics", topic: "Trigonometry", year: 2017, exam: "Post-UTME", university: "UNIBEN",
    faculty: ["engineering", "physicalsciences"],
    question: "Evaluate: (tan240° − tan210°) / (1 + tan240° × tan210°)",
    options: ["√3", "√2", "√2+√3", "√3/3"],
    answer: "√3/3",
    explanation: "This is the tan subtraction formula: tan(A−B) = (tanA−tanB)/(1+tanAtanB). So = tan(240°−210°) = tan30° = 1/√3 = √3/3. tan240° = tan(180°+60°) = tan60° = √3. tan210° = tan(180°+30°) = tan30° = 1/√3. Answer D."

    question: "A man borrows ₦400,000 at simple interest rate 3%. Amount to repay at end of 2 years.",
    options: ["₦424,000", "₦409,000", "₦412,000", "₦418,000"],
    answer: "₦424,000",
    explanation: "SI = PRT/100 = 400,000 × 3 × 2 / 100 = ₦24,000. Total = 400,000 + 24,000 = ₦424,000."

    question: "The velocity of a space shuttle is V = 25 + 30t². Find the instantaneous acceleration at t = 9 seconds.",
    options: ["54 m/s²", "60 m/s²", "20 m/s²", "30 m/s²"],
    answer: "540 m/s²",
    explanation: "a = dV/dt = 60t. At t = 9: a = 60×9 = 540 m/s². UNIBEN answer B (60 m/s²) — this corresponds to t=1 or evaluating the coefficient only. Students should note: the mathematical answer is 540 m/s²; UNIBEN may have intended t=1."
